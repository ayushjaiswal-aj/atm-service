# atm-service

This project contains code for an ATM service that can dispense cash amounts based on denominations of bills.

# Features

Accepts a cash amount from the user as input
Calculates the breakdown of bills required to dispense the amount (e.g. 2 x 500, 1 x 100)
Handles errors if the amount cannot be dispensed exactly with the available denominations

Some potential improvements for the future:

Add a database to store transaction history
Implement a web API for a client application
Support additional currencies and bill denominations
Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
